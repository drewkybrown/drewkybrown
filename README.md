## About Me

Hi, I'm Drew! Blending a background in customer service and management with a growing passion for software engineering, I've recently pivoted into the tech world. I thrive on problem-solving and aim to merge my technical skills with my love for music, seeking roles where innovation meets user experience.

Outside of coding, I'm a music enthusiast, often found DJing or curating playlists. I'm excited to collaborate on projects that make a meaningful impact and bring fresh ideas to life. Let's connect and create something amazing!
